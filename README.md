# Comparative-Study-of-Online-and-Offline-Education

During our Project on “A Comprehensive Study on Myntra Fashion Products” ,we gained valuable insights based 
on sales, ratings, reviews, and price, the dataset displayed well-known brands and fashion accessories.
NLP methods like K-means clustering and TF-IDF scores enhance marketing strategies and e-commerce 
experiences.
A rating, review, prices, and specific-category recommendation system can enhance the purchasing process.
The multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier displayed its ability to distinguish between positive, negative, and neutral 
opinions by correctly categorizing 79.1% of product ratings.
Key Skills: Data Scientist, Data Analyst, python, Tableau, Excel, EDA, Recommendation System, NLP,
